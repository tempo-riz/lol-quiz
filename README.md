# lol-quiz

# quirks

works using nodemon linux/windows

but if build and run fails bcp files are searched under /build/FRONT
works only on linux (no cp on windows... cmdline)

# todo

- create questions
- implement audio/image
- prevent double tap/from multiple player (take only first event into account for each round)

- better interface
- responsive for mobile (xd)
